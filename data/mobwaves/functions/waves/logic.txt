- So the logic behind a single wave is as follows:

(Starts with the marker having no tag, a set mv.waveNum, and no mobs left)
1. Player pulls lever, causing the start_next function to run, which will clear the lever and give a tag to the marker
2. Tagged marker starts running commands every tick (Or every 10 ticks), which will decide which mobs to summon
3. Player kills mobs. Once a certain time and no creepers left have been reached, then the ticks end (a command is run) and the lever is resummoned
        - Ending the time also opens up the shop
            - Villagers in the shop will be on a certain team to keep mobs from being drawn to them.
        - starting will close up the shop.
