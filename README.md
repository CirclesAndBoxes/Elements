## Introduction

This is a Minecraft data pack that gives players special abilities based on a selected class. There are 4 classes based on the 4 archetypal elements: Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. These classes are not meant for PVP battles, but instead Player vs. Entity, or PVE.

Each class has 3 abilities related to their element. The Fire class can cast fireball, Earth class can cast seismic wave, etc. Each class is also built to fulfill a certain purpose in combat: Fire is meant for melee dps, Air meant for ranged dps, Earth focuses on tanking and crowd control, and water is meant for support and healing.

## Selecting a class

How to select a class: 

To select the fire class, run the function
<pre> /function elements:setup/fire </pre>
swap fire with earth, air, water to choose those respective classes as well.

To clear a player of a then run the function
<pre> /function elements:setup/reset </pre>
(This step is ran automatically when selecting classes.)
