## Introduction

This is a Minecraft data pack that gives players special abilities based on a selected class. There are 4 classes based on the 4 archetypal elements: Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. These classes are not meant for PvP, or Player versus Player battles, but instead for Player vs. Entity, or PvE battles.

Each class has 3 abilities related to their element. The Fire class can cast fireball, Earth class can cast seismic wave, etc. Each class is also built to fulfill a certain purpose in combat: Fire is meant for melee dps, Air meant for ranged dps, Earth focuses on tanking and crowd control, and water is meant for support and healing.

## Selecting a class

How to select a class: 

To select the fire class, run the function
<pre> /function elements:setup/fire </pre>
swap fire with earth, air, water to choose those respective classes as well.

To clear a player of a then run the function
<pre> /function elements:setup/reset </pre>
(This step is ran automatically when selecting classes.)

## Further modifications:

This is still a work in progress, but there are some features that can work. To toggle between the default method of "eat to regenerate health" and an automatic regeneration rate the eliminates the need to eat food, run the command:
<pre> /function mobwaves:toggle_regen </pre>
